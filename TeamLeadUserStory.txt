As a Team Lead/ Department Head working for the Edmonton Public Library, 
I want to be able to have my work organized so that I can access it quick 
and on the fly. I would also like to be updated when an 
employee/collaborator has made progress in a task I have assigned them.
Being able to see the overall progress my Department has made on each of 
their individual tasks is important for my planning proccess and helps me 
create reports to present to my superiors.  

I need to be able to create my own tasks that represent my Department/
Teams goals as well as have the ability to pass down the tasks created by
the BP lead.  Deadlines must be met and therefore, I must be able to 
prioritize my own schedule as well as the schedule of others around those
deadlines.  Business Plan goals come before my department/team goals as
well.
