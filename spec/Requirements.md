Summary
=======
The Edmonton Public Library (EPL) develops a business plan every 3-5 years
that is currently tracked using Excel spreadsheets. It is difficult to
maintain the spreadsheets because multiple copies are made throughout
departments. A new web-based system would remove inconsistencies between
departments and provide a rigid structure. It will provide a single point of
access that is easily manageable.
